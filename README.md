# Rainville_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final CSCI 2270 project
My Code is supposed to take in the "Adventurers" past quests and put them into a linked list. It also will delete parts of the list, print off the list as well as insert parts that the "Adventurer" may have missed. Along with this it adds a little fun within the whole code. 

It runs like most of the assignments we have had, input whatever number you want on the main menus to chose a topic and follow the instructions given. 

No dependancies
No system requirements

Bugs -Need help with basics- having issues creating linked list from the inputs from the "adventurers"
I would like some help inserting new "adventures" into the linked list as well as building it.
