# Rainville_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final CSCI 2270 project
My Code is supposed to take in the "Adventurers" past quests and put them into a linked list. It also will delete parts of the list, print off the list as well as insert parts that the "Adventurer" may have missed. Along with this it adds a little fun within the whole code. 

It runs like most of the assignments we have had, input whatever number you want on the main menus to chose a topic and follow the instructions given. 

To run this code from the command line, type "git clone https://github.com/thra9969/Rainville_CSCI2270_FinalProject". Then type "cd Rainville_CSCI2270_FinalProject ". Then type "g++ main.cpp CSCI_2270_Final.cbp". Then type "./a.out".

Bugs -Need help with basics- having issues creating linked list from the inputs from the "adventurers"
I would like some help inserting new "adventures" into the linked list as well as building it.
